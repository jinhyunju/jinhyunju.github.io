## The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm

The purpose of this document is to explain the EM algorithm to myself and anyone
else who can tolerate my bad writing. To ease up the pain of reading, I am including
executable R code that will compensate for the short comings of my writing. 

### The Problem

Let us begin with an example problem that we might want to solve with the EM 
algorithm. In this example, we are going to generate 2 dimensional data from two different 2-D (or multivariate in general) Gaussian distributions. 

```{r}
library(mvtnorm)

data1 <- rmvnorm(100, mean = c(2,2), sigma = diag(2))
data2 <- rmvnorm(100, mean = c(-4,-4), sigma = diag(2))

observed.data <- rbind(data1,data2)

```

A good starting point would be to take a look at the data first. 

```{r, fig.align='center'}

plot(observed.data[,1],observed.data[,2], xlab = "x1", ylab = "x2")


```

We can see two clusters of data points
